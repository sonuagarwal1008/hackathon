Problem Statement:
Women safety is one of the most important aspect but lacks enough means to address it
Solutions involve many mobile apps today that send message – but there is no direct action invocation

Solution:
Here we are connecting people (so instead to sending the message to victim friends, family it will send the message to the person who is located nearby to use victim at the time.), police and technology(drones ) for girls safety. 
we are leveraging benefits of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, IOT and Drones. 
 
1. User will have to install the app on their smart phone and register with their Aadhaar card.        Each user identity will be crossed checked to check user’s criminal records in police database. 

2. User can optionally also agree to be a volunteer to get notified when anyone needs help. User choosing to volunteer, needs to provide preferred area for receiving notification. With this, volunteer will be notified for any SOS request nearby in that area. 
 
3. We will not be tracking any users(volunteers).  Whenever a user(victim) is in a distress situation, user can start the app and press the SOS button. Location service should be on when using the app. On pressing the SOS button, a message with user's location detail and time will be sent via the app to central system via internet and SMS (at least one of these services should be available with the user) 
4. When a user invokes SOS following things happen 
   a. Message with user's location and time will be sent to central system 
   b. From this point onwards, the app will keep tracking the user location and sending to central system on regular basis 
   c. The central system will send an SOS request to Police Control Room who will have the console of this app. Whenever there is a new alert, there will also be a video and audio indication which will remain active till acknowledged by stationed police person at the console 
   d. The central system will also send SMS and app notification with victim's location on google map to registered volunteers who are within 2 km (this setting can be finalized) from the victim location. The volunteers can then reach out to the victim. 
   e. There will also be pair of drones commissioned at certain locations. the nearest pair of drones will autonomously drive themselves to the victim location. In the event of attacker fleeing the scene, one drone will follow the attacker while other drone will continue to remain with the victim till help arrives. The drones will also be equipped with cameras to take pictures at the scene and relay back to police control room. 
f. Drones will have camera which will work in night time and at complex, less visible places. 
drone will have machine learning and image processing capability that will do real-time mapping, path planning and obstacle avoidance and after reaching to the victim location taking right decision and action accordingly.  

Top of that everything will work without internet connectivity. For this we will be using Offline machine learning and processing with minimum storage and hardware requirement.  
 
There could be multiple scenarios and we are taking care of each one:
 
If user(victim) don’t want broadcast feature then at the time of registration she can choose either send it to all or only known people.
 If victim is not in network area then we will use emergency message service (if user mobile network is not available it will use different service provider at that moment).
After pressing the SOS/Help button. App will send a message with user’s location to our centralized system which runs on cloud and their message will be broadcasted to the nearest police station, registered people within 5km (this could be change) diameter of victim and stationed drones will be ready for fly out and will reach to the victim location.

So, after implementation of this women will feel more safe and secure. By a single alert message, women will be able to get help from multiple source.
